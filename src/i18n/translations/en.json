In this project I was one of the frontend developers behind the brand's content and editorial pages used in several campaigns and launches. The concept behind the project consisted in using the ContentStack CMS where the content creators could build the pages using re-usable components that the frontend application would then map into styled React components.

In order for this to work, I had to develop the API which the mobile apps used to create a new fueling session and the consequent communication with the several fuel companies existing in the Netherlands. This was built in Ruby On Rails and PostgreSQL and for monitoring purposes I was also responsible for creating an admin dashboard in which the Tankey shareholders would be able to see which stations were performing the best, which kind of fuel people used the most, the price fluctuation for every single fuel provider in the Netherlands and many other metrics.",

It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881."

It stands between the British Library, the Regent's Canal and London King's Cross railway station, with which it shares a London Underground station, King's Cross St Pancras. The station was constructed by the Midland Railway, which had an extensive rail network across the Midlands and the North of England, but no dedicated line into London. After rail traffic problems following the 1862 International Exhibition, the Midland Railway decided to build a connection from Bedford to London with its own terminus. The station was designed by William Henry Barlow and constructed with a single-span iron roof. Following the station's opening on 1 October 1868, the Midland Railway constructed the Midland Grand Hotel on the station's fa√ßade, which has been widely praised for its architecture and is now a Grade I listed building along with the rest of the station."

During the nineteenth century, the wharf was one of the chief delivery points for ships bringing tea to the Pool of London. At its height, 80% of the dry produce imported to London passed through the wharf, and on this account the wharf was nicknamed 'the Larder of London'. The wharf was largely rebuilt following the Great Fire of Southwark in June 1861 and then continued in use for nearly a century until it was badly bombed in September 1940 during the Second World War."

The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water lakes. The park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly for May Day parades. Major improvements occurred in the early 18th century under the direction of Queen Caroline. Several duels took place in Hyde Park during this time, often involving members of the nobility. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in the park, for which The Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was erected. Free speech and demonstrations have been a key feature of Hyde Park since the 19th century. Speakers' Corner has been established as a point of free speech and debate since 1872, while the Chartists, the Reform League, the suffragettes, and the Stop the War Coalition have all held protests there. In the late 20th century, the park was known for holding large-scale free rock music concerts, featuring groups such as Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and Queen.

It has been nicknamed 'The Walkie-Talkie' because of its distinctive shape, said to resemble a two-way radio handset. Construction was completed in spring 2014, and the three-floor 'sky garden' was opened in January 2015. The 38-storey building is 160 m (525 ft) tall. Since July 2017, the building has been owned by Lee Kum Kee Groups. Designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly and costing over ¬£200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward. The entrance floor and 34 floors of office space are topped by a large viewing deck. A bar and restaurants are included on the 35th, 36th and 37th floors; these are, with restrictions, open to the public. The tower was originally proposed at nearly 200 m (656 ft) tall but its design was scaled down after concerns about its visual impact on the nearby St Paul's Cathedral and Tower of London. It was subsequently approved in 2006 with the revised height. Even after the height reduction there were continued concerns from heritage groups about its impact on the surrounding area. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Ruth Kelly, called in the project for another public inquiry. The project was consequently the subject of a public inquiry; in 2007 this ruled in the developers' favour and the building was granted full planning permission. In 2015 it was awarded the Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building in the UK in the previous 12 months. In 2013 Paul Finch of the Design Council CABE said he regretted supporting the project during the public inquiry, saying that the developers 'made a mess of it' and were architects of their own misfortune."

Collserola is a wonderful natural setting made up of a large forested area of some ten million trees inhabited by a large variety of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and so on. However, this immense area, considered today to be one of the largest natural urban parks in the world, hasn't always been as popular with those who live in Barcelona. One of the main reasons for this was how remote and hard to reach it was. This meant that up to the end of the 19th century it was an area only frequented by day-trippers, shepherds and a few inhabitants who had built houses there. To find the first mention of the mountain in relation to Barcelona, we have to go back to 1283 when King Peter III of Aragon described it as one of the limits of the city. During Medieval times it was known as Puig de l‚Äô√Äliga (Mount Eagle), but it wasn't until the 16th century when the monks of St Jeronimo's monastery gave it its current name:  Tibidabo - a name taken from the gospel of St Matthew and made up of the words 'tibi' and 'dabo' which in Latin mean \"I'll give you\"."

Park G√ºell is the reflection of Gaud√≠'s artistic plenitude, which belongs to his naturalist phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G√ºell, Gaud√≠ unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family."

On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica. On 19 March 1882, construction of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaud√≠ took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaud√≠ devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete. Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, revolutionaries set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaud√≠'s original plans, drawings and plaster models, which led to 16 years of work to piece together the fragments of the master model. Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s. Advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament. It was anticipated that the building would be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaud√≠'s death but this has now been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

The ground floor, in particular, has unusual tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the fa√ßade is decorated with a colorful mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles. The roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur.

It was the last private residence designed by architect Antoni Gaud√≠ and was built between 1906 and 1912. The building was commissioned in 1906 by Pere Mil√† and his wife Roser Segimon. At the time, it was controversial because of its undulating stone facade, twisting wrought iron balconies and designed by Josep Maria Jujol. Several structural innovations include a self-supporting stone fa√ßade, and a free-plan floor, underground garage and the spectacular terrace on the roof. In 1984, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since 2013 it has been the headquarters of the Fundaci√≥ Catalunya La Pedrera which manages the visit to the building, exhibitions and other cultural and educative activities at Casa Mil√†."

The cathedral was constructed from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, with the principal work done in the fourteenth century. The cloister, which encloses the Well of the Geese (Font de les Oques) was completed in 1448. In the late nineteenth century, the neo-Gothic fa√ßade was constructed over the nondescript exterior that was common to Catalan churches. The roof is notable for its gargoyles, featuring a wide range of animals, both domestic and mythical. Its form is pseudo-basilica, vaulted over five aisles, the outer two divided into chapels. The transept is truncated. The east end is a chevet of nine radiating chapels connected by an ambulatory. The high altar is raised, allowing a clear view into the crypt. The cathedral is dedicated to Eulalia of Barcelona, co-patron saint of Barcelona, a young virgin who, according to Catholic tradition, suffered martyrdom during Roman times in the city. One story says that she was exposed naked in the public square and a miraculous snowfall in mid-spring covered her nudity. The enraged Romans put her into a barrel with knives stuck into it and rolled it down a street (according to tradition, the one now called Baixada de Santa Eul√†lia). The body of Saint Eulalia is entombed in the cathedral's crypt."

It is an outstanding example of Catalan Gothic, with a purity and unity of style that is very unusual in large medieval buildings. The first mention of a church of Santa Maria by the Sea dates from 998. The construction of the present building was promoted by the canon Bernat Llull, who was appointed Archdean of Santa Maria in 1324. One of the distinctive features of Santa Maria del Mar was its backing by the common people, as opposed to the nobility. Construction work started on 25 March 1329, when the foundation stone was laid by king Alfonso IV of Aragon as commemorated by a tablet in Latin and Catalan on the fa√ßade that faces the Fossar de les Moreres. The architects in charge were Berenguer de Montagut (designer of the building) and Ramon Despuig, and during the construction all the guilds of the Ribera quarter were involved. The walls, the side chapels and the fa√ßades were finished by 1350. In 1379 there was a fire that damaged important parts of the works. Finally, on 3 November 1383 the last stone was laid and on 15 August 1384 the church was consecrated."

It consists of two small, ecologically different lakes connected by a narrow strait, which is crossed by a bridge. The volcano is located on the western third of the island of S√£o Miguel. The Lagoa das Sete Cidades is part of a natural landscape of communitarian interest: it is the largest body of water in the region and one of the most important freshwater resources in the archipelago. The lake is situated within the caldera of the Sete Cidades Massif, an ancient volcano built on various layers of ash, pyroclasts and trachyte and basaltic lavas. It is a stratovolcano constructed from alternating phases of explosive and effusive ejecta, from dominantly basaltic pre-caldera eruptions, a trachytic caldera-forming stage and a post-caldera stage consisting of alternating trachytic and basaltic eruptions. The caldera-forming eruption was triggered by a basaltic injection into a shallow trachytic magma chamber. These geomorphological structures allowed varying hydrochemical properties and produced many types of springs and water circulation networks. Generally, formations with good hydrodynamic properties include areas with lava flows, basaltic pyroclasts and/or pumice, while solidified Ignimbrites, conditioned by high temperatures and paleosols, such as ash, have produced impermeable conditions. The aquifers are dependent on reduced permeability, or secondary volcanoes with hydrogeologically significant volumes. Consequently, the accumulation of ash at the bottom of the craters and caldera has conditioned the formation of lakes."

Back then, it was more expensive to fly from Europe to North America than it was to these beautiful Portuguese islands. So, investors invested and builders built, and this 5-star resort was open for business in 1989. The large complex featured two restaurants, a bar, nightclub, hairdressers, bank, and 88 rooms that overlooked either the Atlantic Ocean or the twin lakes nestled in the caldera of the volcano. Ironically, the Monte Palace hotel received the award for being Portugal's finest on the same week that the hotel closed its doors for good.

The landscape is still marked by manicured garden parks associated with important socio-cultural and patrimonial traits. The lake, as well as the center of the Furnas community is included in a protected area of 7,784 acres. Geologically, the Furnas Volcano is one of three active volcanoes on the island of S√£o Miguel and bears great geological significance in the Azores. It corresponds to a stratovolcano with a caldera collapse, stratigraphically characterized by the alternation of lava flows and predominantly trachytic and pyroclastic materials, such as ash and pumice. Currently, the dominant plant communities include a large number of exotic species, some with invading character: the Australian Cheesewood (Pittosporum undulatum) and Australian Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) are two examples, in addition to the Yellow Ginger-Lilly (Hedychium gardnerianum) and Chilean Rhubarb (Gunnera tinctoria).

Its first builders, Matthias of Arras and later Peter Parler, built the chancel with a ring of chapels, St. Wenceslas Chapel, the Golden Gate and the lower part of the Great South Tower. It was already Peter Parler who started the construction of the South Tower, however he did not complete it. In the 16th century, is was finished with a Renaissance view gallery and a helmet. Later in the 18th century, the older helmet was replaced by a new dome. Unfortunately, in 1419 the construction of the Cathedral stopped because of the Hussite Wars. In spite of the endeavours of some sovereigns to secure the continuation of the construction work, the Cathedral remained uncompleted for whole centuries. The facade of the Cathedral was provisionally closed and for example the music choir was bulit. It was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the Union for the Completion of the Cathedral began the repair of the original part and the completion of the Cathedral in Neo-Gothic style.

It flourished in the early Middle Ages, in the last third of the 11th and first half of the 12th century, when it rivalled and for a while even outshone Prague Castle in its grandeur. This was all down to prince and first Czech King Vratislav II (ruled 1061-1092), who like several of his immediate successors chose the Vy≈°ehrad clifftop for his fortified royal headquarters and the main P≈ôemyslid dynastic seat. The earliest stone buildings date from this period. The coronation of Vladislav II in 1140 put Prague Castle back in favour. Vy≈°ehrad's star rose again with Czech King and Roman Emperor Charles IV (ruled 1346-1378), and his avowed P≈ôemyslid lineage. A magnificent reconstruction, following-on from the founding of the New Town of Prague, made Vy≈°ehrad Castle a prime palatial edifice with an important role in Czech coronations. During the Hussite wars the castle was plundered and destroyed. Its walls also suffered in the double besieging of Prague by the Swedes in 1639 and 1648. The faded glory of the Royal residence was restored only in the second half of the 17th century, turning it into a Baroque military fortress. This construction work gave Vy≈°ehrad its current citadel layout, with its mighty brick ramparts and the imposing Leopold gate. The 19th century changed the character of Vy≈°ehrad by adding the Slav√≠n cemetery for the nation's greats, and the neo-Gothic Basilica of St Peter and Paul.

The plot and structure lay decrepit until 1960, when the area was cleared. The neighboring plot was co-owned by the family of V√°clav Havel, who spent most of his life there. As early as 1986, Vlado Miluniƒá, then a respected architect in the Czechoslovak milieu, conceived an idea for a project at the place and discussed it with his neighbour, the then little-known dissident V√°clav Havel. A few years later, during the Velvet Revolution, Havel became a popular leader and was subsequently elected president of Czechoslovakia. Thanks to his authority, the idea to develop the site grew. Havel eventually decided to have Miluniƒá survey the site, hoping for it to become a cultural center, though this was not the result. The Dutch insurance company Nationale-Nederlanden (ING Bank from 1991 to 2016) agreed to sponsor the construction of a house on site. The bank chose Miluniƒá as the lead designer and asked him to partner with another world-renowned architect to approach the process. The French architect Jean Nouvel turned down the idea because of the small square footage, but the Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry accepted the invitation. Because of the bank's excellent financial state at the time, it was able to offer almost unlimited funding for the project. Starting with their first meeting in 1992 in Geneva, Gehry and Miluniƒá began to develop Miluniƒá's original idea of a building consisting of two parts, static and dynamic (yin and yang), which were to symbolize the transition of Czechoslovakia from a communist regime to a parliamentary democracy."

          "description": "The Church of the Assumption of the Buda Castle, more commonly known as the Matthias Church, more rarely the Coronation Church of Buda, is a Roman Catholic church located in the Holy Trinity Square, Budapest, Hungary, in front of the Fisherman's Bastion at the heart of Buda's Castle District. According to church tradition, it was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015, although few references exist. The current building was constructed in the florid late Gothic style in the second half of the 14th century and was extensively restored in the late 19th century. It was the second largest church of medieval Buda and the seventh largest church of the medieval Hungarian Kingdom. It is a historic building with an important history. Two Kings of Hungary were crowned within its walls: Franz Joseph I of Hungary and Elisabeth, and Charles IV of Hungary and Zita of Bourbon-Parma. The church was also the location of the 'Marian Miracle' of Buda. In 1686, during the siege of Buda city by the Holy League, a wall of the church - used as a mosque by the Ottoman occupiers of the city - collapsed due to cannon fire. It turned out that an old votive Madonna statue was hidden behind the wall. As the sculpture of the Virgin Mary appeared before the praying Muslims, the morale of the Muslim garrison collapsed and the city fell on the same day."

          "description": "The Doh√°ny Street Synagogue, also known as the Great Synagogue or Tabakgasse Synagogue, is a historical building in Erzs√©betv√°ros, the 7th district of Budapest, Hungary. It is the largest synagogue in Europe, seating 3,000 people and is a centre of Neolog Judaism. The synagogue was built between 1854 and 1859 in the Moorish Revival style, with the decoration based chiefly on Islamic models from North Africa and medieval Spain (the Alhambra). The synagogue's Viennese architect, Ludwig F√∂rster, believed that no distinctively Jewish architecture could be identified, and thus chose 'architectural forms that have been used by oriental ethnic groups that are related to the Israelite people, and in particular the Arabs'. The interior design is partly by Frigyes Feszl. The Doh√°ny Street Synagogue complex consists of the Great Synagogue, the Heroes' Temple, the graveyard, the Memorial and the Jewish Museum, which was built on the site on which Theodor Herzl's house of birth stood. Doh√°ny Street itself, a leafy street in the city center, carries strong Holocaust connotations as it constituted the border of the Budapest Ghetto."

          "description": "The Hungarian Parliament Building, also known as the Parliament of Budapest after its location, is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, a notable landmark of Hungary, and a popular tourist destination in Budapest. It is situated on Kossuth Square in the Pest side of the city, on the eastern bank of the Danube. It was designed by Hungarian architect Imre Steindl in neo-Gothic style and opened in 1902. It has been the largest building in Hungary since its completion. Budapest was united from three cities in 1873, namely Buda, √ìbuda, and Pest. Seven years later the Diet resolved to establish a new, representative parliament building, expressing the sovereignty of the nation. The building was planned to face the Danube River. An international competition was held, and Imre Steindl emerged as the victor; the plans of two other competitors were later also realized in the form of the Ethnographic Museum and the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture, both facing the Parliament Building. Construction from the winning plan was started in 1885, and the building was inaugurated on the presumed 1,000th anniversary of the country in 1896. It was not fully completed until 1904. The architect of the building first went blind and then later, died before its completion."

          "description": "The Hungarian National Museum was founded in 1802 and is the national museum for the history, art, and archaeology of Hungary, including areas not within Hungary's modern borders, such as Transylvania; it is not to be confused with the collection of international art in the Hungarian National Gallery. The museum is in Budapest VIII in a Neoclassical building, purpose-built during 1837‚Äì47 by the architect Mih√°ly Pollack. The Hungarian National Museum traces its foundation to 1802, when Count Ferenc Sz√©ch√©nyi set up the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library. This would then be followed a year later by the donating of a mineral collection by Sz√©ch√©nyi's wife. This led to the creation of the Hungarian National Museum as a general history and natural history museum, beyond being simply a library. In 1807, the Hungarian National Parliament passed legislation on the new institution and asked the nation to help donate to the museum. In 1848, the Hungarian National Museum played a major role in the Hungarian Revolution. The Revolution was partially spurred by the reading of S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi's 12 points and the famous poem Nemzeti dal on the front steps of the museum. This helped make the museum a major site of national importance and identity for Hungary. In remembrance of the revolution, two statues were added to the museum: the first is a statue of J√°nos Arany, unveiled in 1883. In 1890, there was a statue next to the stairs of the museum of a memorial tablet to S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi. Additionally, during this time, the Upper House of the parliament held its sessions in the Cereminial of the museum. This continued until the new house of Parliament was built. Today, festivities held in remembrance of the National Commemorations Day of 1848 are held in front of the museum."

          "description": "The Fisherman's Bastion is one of the best known monuments in Budapest, located near the Buda Castle, in the 1st district of Budapest. It is one of the most important tourist attractions due to the unique panorama of Budapest from the Neo-Romanesque lookout terraces. The Fishermen's Bastion's main fa√ßade, parallel to the Danube, is approximately 140 meters long, of which the southern aisle is about 40 meters long, the north is 65 meters long, and the ornate central parapet is 35 meters long. Its seven high-pitched stone towers symbolize the seven chieftains of the Hungarians who founded Hungary in 895. The original walls were built in the 1700s, forming part of the walls of a castle. Several historians say that in the Middle Ages this part of the castle walls was protected by the guild of fishermen, who lived under the walls in the so-called Fishtown or Watertown. The current structure was built between 1895 and 1902, in Neo-Romanesque style, on the base of a stretch of the Buda Castle walls, by architect Frigyes Schulek, who was also responsible for the restoration of the Matthias Church. Since 1987 it has been one of Budapest's World Heritage Sites as part of the V√°rker√ºlet District (Buda Castle District)."

It is named in honour of Stephen, the first King of Hungary, whose right hand is housed in the reliquary. It was the sixth largest church building in Hungary before 1920. Since the renaming of the primatial see, it has been the co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest. Today, it is the third largest church building in present-day Hungary. The site of today's basilica was a theater in the 18th century. This theater, named Hetz-Theater, was a place where animal fights were hosted. One of the wealthy citizens (J√°nos Zitterbarth) of the newly formed district built a temporary church there. In the late 1810s, about a thousand people formed the Lip√≥tv√°ros Parish. Then they began the fundraising and the believers started to make plans for the future church. This is the most important church building in Hungary, one of the most significant tourist attractions and the third highest church in Hungary."

          "description": "The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, which is sometimes nicknamed 'il salotto di Milano' (Milan's drawing room), is an elegant nineteenth-century shopping arcade. It houses some of the most luxurious boutiques in Milan. The structure built between 1865 and 1877 is formed by two arcades shaped like a Latin cross covered by a glass and iron dome. The Galleria is located between two of the main monuments in Milan: il Duomo and the Teatro alla Scala. In our opinion, this magnificent shopping arcade is one of the most interesting sights in Milan. The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II contains brands such as Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton, as well as other high-end boutiques. It also houses numerous well-decorated restaurants, including some of the oldest establishments of Milan such as Caf√© Biffi, founded in 1867. Surprisingly, visitors can also find a McDonald's in the Gallery. This said, the fast-food restaurant is beautifully decorated with black columns and gold decoration to blend in with the other establishments. It has a comfortable terrace to sit in and have an inexpensive drink, while enjoying the atmosphere and elegance of this stunning building."
