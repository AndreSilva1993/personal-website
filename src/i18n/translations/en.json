      "burberry": "Burberry is a British luxury fashion house headquartered in London, England. It currently designs and distributes ready to wear including trench coats (for which it is most famous), leather goods, footwear, fashion accessories, eye-wear, fragrances, and cosmetics. Established in 1856 by Thomas Burberry, originally focusing on the development of outdoor attire, the house has moved into the high fashion market, developing gabardine, and products made exclusively for the brand. In this project I was one of the frontend developers behind the brand's content and editorial pages used in several campaigns and launches. The concept behind the project consisted in using the ContentStack CMS where the content creators could build the pages using re-usable components that the frontend application would then map into styled React components. To achieve this the project was developed using the React framework Next.js alongside TypeScript, Emotion, HTML 5 and CSS 3.",
      "tankey": "Tankey is a dutch mobile app which allows their customers in the Netherlands to refuel their cars while saving money in a direct and straight-forward manner. They just have to select the station they're currently at and the fuel pump they're using and as soon as they're ready to pay, the discount has already been provided in the total value. In order for this to work, I had to develop the API which the mobile apps used to create a new fueling session and the consequent communication with the several fuel companies existing in the Netherlands. This was built in Ruby On Rails and PostgreSQL and for monitoring purposes I was also responsible for creating an admin dashboard in which the Tankey shareholders would be able to see which stations were performing the best, which kind of fuel people used the most, the price fluctuation for every single fuel provider in the Netherlands and many other metrics."
