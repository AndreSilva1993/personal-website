      "burberry": "Burberry is a British luxury fashion house headquartered in London, England. It currently designs and distributes ready to wear including trench coats (for which it is most famous), leather goods, footwear, fashion accessories, eye-wear, fragrances, and cosmetics. Established in 1856 by Thomas Burberry, originally focusing on the development of outdoor attire, the house has moved into the high fashion market, developing gabardine, and products made exclusively for the brand. In this project I was one of the frontend developers behind the brand's content and editorial pages used in several campaigns and launches. The concept behind the project consisted in using the ContentStack CMS where the content creators could build the pages using re-usable components that the frontend application would then map into styled React components. To achieve this the project was developed using the React framework Next.js alongside TypeScript, Emotion, HTML 5 and CSS 3.",
      "tankey": "Tankey is a dutch mobile app which allows their customers in the Netherlands to refuel their cars while saving money in a direct and straight-forward manner. They just have to select the station they're currently at and the fuel pump they're using and as soon as they're ready to pay, the discount has already been provided in the total value. In order for this to work, I had to develop the API which the mobile apps used to create a new fueling session and the consequent communication with the several fuel companies existing in the Netherlands. This was built in Ruby On Rails and PostgreSQL and for monitoring purposes I was also responsible for creating an admin dashboard in which the Tankey shareholders would be able to see which stations were performing the best, which kind of fuel people used the most, the price fluctuation for every single fuel provider in the Netherlands and many other metrics.",
      "carmo": "Carmo is made up of a group of 10 companies based in Portugal, and the whole process of transformation, product creation, and technical development is Portuguese. Carmo offers a wide range of products in the national territory and across borders, in sectors as diverse as agriculture, the equestrian world, construction, tourism, leisure, security, and telecommunications. To promote this brand, I helped develop a website where the users could see their diverse catalogue using HTML 5, CSS 3, PHP framework Yii 2 and jQuery.",
      "toconline": "TOConline is one of the biggest billing and accounting program in Portugal which allows tens of thousands of accountants and managers run every single aspect of their company on it. Management of their employees, contracts, salaries, sales, purchases, assets, accounting / billing were some of the features provided by TOConline and the product was in constant evolution as the company established a close communication with their customers which constantly requested new features. In this particular project I was responsible for the development and management of re-usable Polymer components that the other developers would use to create new pages and features. Those components would range from simple ones as buttons, labels, badges to more complex ones such as a full-on data grid with data fetching, pagination, caching and re-fetching when the information was marked as stale and so many other features. To a lesser extent, I've also developed some small features on the backend side of things using Ruby and PostgreSQL."

      "british-museum": "The British Museum is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture located in the Bloomsbury area of London, England. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely collected during the era of the British Empire. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. It was the first public national museum in the world. The Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.",
      "national-gallery": "The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it attracted only 1,197,143 visitors, a drop of 50 per cent from 2019, but it still ranked eighth on the list of most-visited art museums in the world.",
      "london-eye": "The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3 million visitors annually. It has made many appearances in popular culture. The structure is 135 metres tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres. When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 160 metres Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 167 metres High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel",
      "natural-history-museum": "The Natural History Museum in London is a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road. The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature—both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling."
